# mixedMessages Project - CodeCademy

In this project I was tasked with creating a small node.js console program, which printed a random message to the screen each time the program is run.

I chose to create a word of the day generator. I figured it could be eventually updated to have a dictionary api connected with a complete dictionary in it, but for now it only has 6 words. Quite a small vocabulary unfortunatly.

## How to run this program

### Requirements

- node.js installed
- terminal

You can run this project simply by downloading the main.js file and navigating to the folder you have the files in and entering node main.js

Thats it enjoy!
